So I've been keeping track of what components come from items when you scrap them for some time now, probably roughly two years across several vaults.  I've recorded the salvage components for a little over 1400 items, mainly rare weapons and armor.  

There are a few caveats and potential pitfalls, however.  Since I was playing the game I ended up barely ever scrapping higher tier weapons and armor so there is only about 50 Legendary items worth of data.  Also, all data was entered into a Google spreadsheet manually so there's always room for human error during that process.

Now, to summarize my findings:

*  It is better to scrap and sell the components for Rare and Legendary items.
*  Common items should be sold as is.

By the numbers:

Table | Common | Rare | Legendary | Total
---------|---------|----------|----------|----------
Quantity | 176 | 1186 | 49 | 1411
Sold Sum | 1760 | 118600 | 24500 | 144860
Scrap Sum | 290 | 140210 | 32750 | 173250
Sold Per Qty | 10 | 100 | 500
Scrap Per Qty | 1.65 | 118.22 | 668.37

So, to summarize the numbers directly:

*  Scrapping and selling Common items yields roughly **85% fewer** caps
*  Scrapping and selling Rare items yields roughly **18% more** caps
*  Scrapping and selling Legendary items yields roughly **33% more** caps

This was kind of a fun little project over the years so hopefully someone else might find this interesting or useful.
